                  Sparks donation is an organization that is established to help the society in different ways. The donations can be used to help a group of people somewhere in the world, promoting recyclable products to save the world or by supporting sports and arts. The aims of the charity have been divided into different categories that have approved by the law as charitable donations. It can be associated with the relief or prevention of poverty or promotion of culture, arts, science, technology, and heritage. The charity values match, the public benefits and they have been established on certain terms. The only purpose of the charity is to help others and nothing else. The other aim of the charity is to avoid donations that are not charitable and stop the people that are trying to make a profit from a charity. Organizations dealing with nonprofit donations are not allowed to make any profit. Every penny they have raised should be donated to achieve their aims. There are no shareholders or owners of a charity that can benefit from the charity donations.
